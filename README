The Unified Service Description Language (USDL) defines a way to describe services from a business
and operational point of view and align this with the technical perspective. While the latter is
captured quite well by existing service description languages, USDL explicitly enables to express
business characteristics set by an organization for the purpose of providing means for consumers to
invoke and use business services and for intermediaries to (re)use and repurpose services. A detailed
explanation of the scope and objectives of USDL is given in “USDL Technical Overview Paper”.

Integrating USDL with JQuery allows us to use all of the methods in this Java Script library manipulate the
DOM in some manner. A few of them simply change one of the attributes of an element. This provides abstractions 
for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets, built on top of the 
jQuery JavaScript Library, that allow us to build highly interactive web applications.
